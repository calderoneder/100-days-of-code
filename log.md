# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 31st, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Finished a simple game using Python modules named Pygame.  Commits are in a public repo at the link below.

**Thoughts:** I have been meaning to start logging my coding progress on here for some time but today is finally the day I decided to do so. I definitely struggled as I started coding a few months ago but was only able to commit a small amount of time to studying and coding. I have more free time now and I am committed to transitioning towards a career in software engineering.
