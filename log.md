# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 31st, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Finished a simple game using Python modules named Pygame.  Commits are in a public repo at the link below.

**Thoughts:** I have been meaning to start logging my coding progress on here for some time but today is finally the day I decided to do so. I definitely struggled as I started coding a few months ago but was only able to commit a small amount of time to studying and coding. I have more free time now and I am committed to transitioning towards a career in software engineering.

### Day 2: April 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started a Data Visualization project. It involves exploring data through visual representations and closely associated with data analysis.

**Thoughts** Now that I'm starting to understand Python better I'm able to read and work through the material a lot faster. Today I got about halfway through a project that I started on the same day. It feels good to make this type of jump right now and plan on doubling down on more projects next week.

### Day 3: April 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got stuck on a bug and switched to work on something else.

**Thoughts** This was the first time in a while that I got stuck on a bug in my code and wasn't able to figure it out for a couple hours. I switched to work on some other work but came back ang figured it out with a clear head.

### Day 4: April 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 3-Day Staycation. Worked on the Data Visualization Project.

**Thoughts** Went up to the mountains with family for the weekend and didn't code too much but made some progress. I was able to get far on this project the first day I got back. Now that I'm picking up on things a lot faster its been a smoother process learning the material and most likely why I was able to to progress the way I have so far.

### Day 5: April 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the Data Viz Project. Started planning next projects.

**Thoughts** I thought I would be able to finish the Data Visualization Project that I had been working on for a few days but I got stuck and had to do a massive Google hunt for the right help I needed. I expect to have more of these moving forward as I've decided to start The Odin Project to learn JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and node.js to prepare to join a bootcamp hopefully in June. Either way, I know that after completing the selected courses from The Odin Project, I will probably be ready for a job in web development. Eventually, I'll come back to working on Python projects because is the language I'm most interested in long term.

### Day 6: April 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Data Visualization Project. Started a new Web Application Project and started The Odin Project introductory reading.

**Thoughts** I decided to finish the last Python project from the book I have instead of starting The Odin Project right away but this shouldn't take me more than a coupld days. I feel great about the transition to other languages because I'm understanding the language a lot better than before and the terminology will not be as foreign. The syntax will take time but that sort of struggle is expected.
