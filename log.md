# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 31st, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Finished a simple game using Python modules named Pygame.  Commits are in a public repo at the link below.

**Thoughts:** I have been meaning to start logging my coding progress on here for some time but today is finally the day I decided to do so. I definitely struggled as I started coding a few months ago but was only able to commit a small amount of time to studying and coding. I have more free time now and I am committed to transitioning towards a career in software engineering.

### Day 2: April 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started a Data Visualization project. It involves exploring data through visual representations and closely associated with data analysis.

**Thoughts** Now that I'm starting to understand Python better I'm able to read and work through the material a lot faster. Today I got about halfway through a project that I started on the same day. It feels good to make this type of jump right now and plan on doubling down on more projects next week.

### Day 3: April 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got stuck on a bug and switched to work on something else.

**Thoughts** This was the first time in a while that I got stuck on a bug in my code and wasn't able to figure it out for a couple hours. I switched to work on some other work but came back ang figured it out with a clear head.

### Day 4: April 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 3-Day Staycation. Worked on the Data Visualization Project.

**Thoughts** Went up to the mountains with family for the weekend and didn't code too much but made some progress. I was able to get far on this project the first day I got back. Now that I'm picking up on things a lot faster its been a smoother process learning the material and most likely why I was able to to progress the way I have so far.

### Day 5: April 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the Data Viz Project. Started planning next projects.

**Thoughts** I thought I would be able to finish the Data Visualization Project that I had been working on for a few days but I got stuck and had to do a massive Google hunt for the right help I needed. I expect to have more of these moving forward as I've decided to start The Odin Project to learn JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and node.js to prepare to join a bootcamp hopefully in June. Either way, I know that after completing the selected courses from The Odin Project, I will probably be ready for a job in web development. Eventually, I'll come back to working on Python projects because is the language I'm most interested in long term.

### Day 6: April 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Data Visualization Project. Started a new Web Application Project and started The Odin Project introductory reading.

**Thoughts** I decided to finish the last Python project from the book I have instead of starting The Odin Project right away but this shouldn't take me more than a coupld days. I feel great about the transition to other languages because I'm understanding the language a lot better than before and the terminology will not be as foreign. The syntax will take time but that sort of struggle is expected.

### Day 1: April 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on The Odin Project. 

**Thoughts** I decided to start my 100 days over again because I didn't code two days out of the last week and I want to make a commitment to the rules I set out in the beginning. Moving forward, I will code at least one hour every day until the 100 days are complete. Aside from that, I completed two projects in Python and started a wep app project using Django last week into this week. This week I decided to transition to coursework in The Odin Project because it has the most comprehensive guides I've found so far. The past two days I completed the Introductory course and today learned about hwo the Internet works.

### Day 2: April 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Continued the intro section of TOP and started to use the command line to navigate files/folders.

**Thoughts:** I spent a couple hours Saturday morning reading the intro section of The Odin Project which was a bunch of articles and videos about various subjects related to learning JavaScript. When learning Python, I didn't have curated resources like these to learn as background information on these subjects which has been useful so far.

### Day 3: April 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Spent Sunday with family but squeezed in an hour in the morning.

**Thoughts:** Only had an hour to spare in the morning but I want to commit at least an hour a day without missing one day for at least those first 100 days. So far, so good.

### Day 4: April 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Struggled through the command line section of The Odin Project intro section. Started the prepwork for a bootcamp I plan to join.

**Thoughts:** The command line is something that I struggled with while learning Python and made me pause on a web app project I started. I think getting this overview, although about a different programming language, is helping me understand the overall utility about it much more. I also started the prepwork for a bootcamp that I plan to join in June after (hopefully) completing The Odin Project. It seems a little more advanced than where I'm right now so I'll be focusing on TOP coursework for a couple days.

### Day 5: April 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Started the Git section of TOP. Decided to buy a monitor to help learning process.

**Thoughts:** I've been using Github for a while but today was the first time I installed Git on my computer. I had never really done too any research besides surface-level reading in articles and online. Although its a lot of new terminology that I'm not grasping immediately, learning this now will be useful down the line. Also, decided to buy a monitor to help my workflow and I will be probably need one soon anyway. Spent some time in the afternoon on this once I got distracted.

### Day 6: April 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Didn't have a lot time to work on Top this morning. 

**Thoughts:** I spent most of my day helping out my dad with something that he needed for his restaurant and it took away from coding time during the day which is when I'm able to get most of my work done. Still was able to move on to other sections of the TOP Git tutorials.

### Day : April th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed a simple Git project. Started the Front-End Development section.

**Thoughts:** Although the monotony of tutorials is tiring after I had been coding already with Python for a while, I can definitely see the benefit of learning the foundations of programming. I already want to start coding because I do think that working on projects is the best way to learn and definitely the best way I was able to grasp the material when learning Python. Regardless, I'll get around to the projects soon and this knowledge will help long-term. I was able to complete a simple Git project to learn how to best use Git and Github together. Still have a a lot to learn about Git but I plan on exploring projects using git and will try to incorporate simple Git tools to my workflow.
